# Last Viewer

This VueJS application is a foot scan & shoe last model viewer built on ThreeJS. Its partially designed towards low-spec browsers and mobile platforms (including Android WebView).

The foot measurments supported are specified on [IWL's Foot Measurement Page](http://www.iwl.jp/content/mark_dimension.html).

The 3D model extensions that are supported are:

- OBJ's generated by IWL's FileConverter from IWL's FBD format
- STL (ASCII) files

Note:
Generic Wavefront OBJ's may work however anatomical landmarks must conform to IWL's FileConverters output to work.

If you are interested in collaboration/integration/development contact me at george.crary@iwl.jp
